##### A) **Systemic Focus** "Architected knowledge management systems that anticipate user behavior  patterns, implementing information hierarchy and scope gates to ensure technical documentation serves as effective decision-support tools"

##### B) **Impact Focus** "Built reusable documentation templates with structural pattern interrupts that increased prerequisite compliance and reduced support tickets from incomplete technical context"

*Note: For a systems engineer role, emphasize the **systems thinking** aspect as well as the **business impact**—that you designed a reusable template (system) rather than just writing good docs (output). The key differentiator is showing you think about documentation as infrastructure that shapes behavior in order to create tangible positive outcomes, not just information storage.*

### *Info*
##### Ansible control nodes can use either SSH or WInRM protocols to connect to a host. There are also various methods to handle host authentication and credential storage that are more or less suited to different kinds of environments. This guide covers methods for configuring your Ansible inventory for both Windows and Linux hosts,  as well as for lab and production environments.

### Adding a Windows Host Configured with WinRM and Basic Auth

```ad-warning
**Do not use basic auth in production environments. Only do this when getting familiar with Ansible or prototyping and where security is not a concern. Use Kerberos or Ansible Vaults in production**
```

#### 1. Navigate to the Ansible root folder containing the control node Inventory.ini
```ad-bash
collapse: true
	cd /path/to/ansible/inventory
```

#### 2. Open up the inventory.ini in a text editor like nano
```ad-bash
collapse: true
	 nano inventory.ini
```

#### 3. Add windows host config (username, password, winrm enabled)
##### Inventory Structure

###### **Group Name** Separates hosts into groups by category
```ad-bash
	# this group will contain hosts running the windows operating system
	[windows] 
	# windows hosts here
```

###### **Host Name and inline variables** The host name is defined first, followed by any inline variables that apply to that specific host
```ad-bash
	[windows] 
	# host name followed by the ansible_host inline variable containing the hosts local ip address
	win_host_1 ansible_host=192.168.1.123
	# add more windows hosts here
```

###### **Group variables** Group variables are applied to all hosts in a group. 

```
```ad-bash
collapse: true
	[windows] 
	win_host_1 ansible_host=192.168.1.123
	
	# vars you want to apply to all [windows] hosts
	[windows:vars]
	ansible_user=host_admin_username
	ansible_password=host_admin_password
	ansible_port=5985
	ansible_connection=winrm
	ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
	...
```

#### 4. Save changes and exit editor - `Ctrl + o` and `Enter` then `Ctrl + x` in Nano
#### 5. Test connection to host
```ad-bash
collapse: true
	# 'windows' is the section name, substitute for whatever your section name is
	ansible windows win_ping -i inventory.ini
```

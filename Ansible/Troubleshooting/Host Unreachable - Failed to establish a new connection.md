#### Where encountered: 
- Testing connection for windows hosts in inventory.ini configured to connect via winrm
#### Why it occurred
- I'm using WinRM in the Ansible windows host inventory.
- When WinRM is specified Ansible attempts to connect to the host default WinRM port 5986 which is for reserved for HTTPS
- Using HTTPS on port 5986 requires a certificate, which my host currently doesn't have (its running on my homelab, its fine) 
- Without a certificate my server is only actively listening on HTTP port 5985
- Therefore the connection request to port 5986 was refused
#### Fix 
- Check what winrm ports have active listeners-> Result: Only listening on 5985 with HTTP protocol
```ad-pscode
	winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener
```
- Specify port 5986 in inventory host vars.
